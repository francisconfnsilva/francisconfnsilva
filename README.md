# Hi, I'm Francisco 👋​

I am a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at Technical University of Lisbon, currently bridging the gap between Control Theory, Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Current Research Interests

* **Neuro-AI Alignment:** Investigating how biological agents solve partial observability and temporal credit assignment in complex navigation tasks.
* * **Reinforcement Learning:** Investigating Finite State Controllers with explicit memory modules to resolve partial observability in biological agents. I also follow the emerging intersection of Policy Gradients (iGRPO) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for optimizing reasoning in LLMs.
* **Efficient LLMs:** Developing **sparse attention mechanisms** and continuous-time memory architectures to extend the context window of LLMs.
* **Biophysics:** Using statistical mechanics to model dynamic systems and learning.

### Current Projects

* **Champalimaud Foundation (Research Fellow)**
    Modeling foraging behavior as a RL agents with explicit memory modules. I am benchmarking finite state controllers against real rodent tracking data to understand how biological agents optimize policies under model uncertainty.

* **IT-Lisbon / DECOLLAGE (Visiting Researcher)**
    Contributing to the ERC-funded DECOLLAGE project by developing continuous video representations for Transformers and sparse attention kernels for Multilingual LLMs (EuroLLM). My work aims to replace dense, unstructured attention with structured sparsity.

### Selected Achievements

* **Open Source Contributor:** Integrated and validated clinical-grade algorithms for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis into the BioSPPy Python library.
* **Biophysics Simulation:** Modeled thermodynamic phase transitions using **Cahn-Hilliard gradient dynamics** and regular solution theory at Chalmers University of Technology.
* **Student Full-Stack Developer:** Architected a secure, **ACID-compliant** Boat Management System (Python/SQL) with defense-in-depth security protocols.
